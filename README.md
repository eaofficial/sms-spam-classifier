# sms-spam-classifier
This project classifies an sms as spam or not spam. The model implements bag of words and count vectorizer from scratch as well as using a library. It uses Naive Bias algorithm as it is a formidable algo for classifying spam or not spam.
However, if you want to use it on emails just set parameter stop_words = 'english'.
